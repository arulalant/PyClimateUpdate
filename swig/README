These files allow you to create the files JDTime_wrap.c,
JDTime_wrap.doc and JDTime.py which give access to the C functions
related to Julian Days and pydcdflib_wrap.doc and pydcdflib_wrap.c
which give access to the C functions which are the interface to DCDFLIB.C
library. If you care about SWIG and are interested in changing the
standard distribution of pyclimate to the extent of changing the 
access to those C modules, you should start changing these files.
Otherwise, just forget them.

I used swig this way:
swig -python -shadow -make_default JDTime.i
swig -python -shadow -make_default pydcdflb.i

Then, copy the generated *_wrap.c and JDTime.py and pydcdflib.py to
../src and rebuild pyclimate as usual.
