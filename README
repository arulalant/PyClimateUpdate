PyClimate:

WHAT IS THIS?
This package is devoted to the analysis of climate variability using Python.
It provides functions to perform some simple IO operations,
operations with COARDS-compliante netCDF files, EOF analysis, SVD
analysis of coupled data sets, linear digital filters, kernel
based probabilitydensity function estimation and access to DCDFLIB.C
library from Python.

Almost all distributed code is original, but, just for ease of
installation, the following code is distributed with pyclimate, 
althought it is not ours:
cdflib.h
dcdflib.c
ipmpar.c - Currently selected IEEE machines.
They are the sources of DCDFLIB.C, by Barry W. Brown, James Lovato and
Kathy Russell, distributed by StatLib and the University of Texas,
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. You can have to touch ipmpa.c, depending
on the target machine.

CONTENTS - DIRECTORIES
src
The source code (C and Python) of the extensions in the package.

swig
The source code for SWIG in case there is any user willing to change
the original C code which is used to build some of the extensions
(namely, JDTime.c and pycdf.c). You are probably not interested in 
these files...

test
pyclimatetest.py is a regression test which should allow you to be
confident that the routines are working properly at your computer.
Just execute it (python pyclimatetest.py) and it will let you know.

doc
Some documentation. Work in progess yet!

examples
Some Python scripts which show the use of the functions in the
package.
